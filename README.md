# Spreadsheets
This repository just contains all of the spreadsheets I used to analyze different datasets. Most of them may be robotics related, but a few others are not. The file name should specificy which is which. Here is a basic explanation of each file:

Robotics: 

All Saints VRC: Data anlysis for the [All Saints VRC tournament](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-23-1935.html#teams). Certain teams are analyzed because that is what my friends asked for.

Battle of the Bridge VRC: Data anlysis for the [Battle of the Bridge VRC tournament](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-23-1793.html#results-). Certain teams are analyzed because that is what my friends asked for.

Haunted VRC: Data anlysis for the [Haunted VRC tournament](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-23-1482.html#results-). Certain teams are analyzed because that is what my friends asked for.

Other:

Ramsette Controller Zeta and B constant change Experiment: This file contains my analysis and data collection for an experiment I was running to determine the best constants for a Ramsette controller on our robot, as well as to better understand how the constants effected the controller to help the tuning process.
